		<h1>My response to Kate Wagner's "404 Page Not Found"</h1>
	</header>
	<div id="container">
		<p>In her essay "404 Page Not Found," Kate Wagner offers a critical perspective on how the internet has evolved
			from
			an open, democratic space to a more commercialized, algorithm driven environment. Wagner’s argument revolves
			around the transformation of the internet from a platform for creativity, free expression, and authentic
			community building to one dominated by corporate interests, algorithms, and the chasing of profit. This
			shift
			she argues, has basically changed the nature of the internet, moving it away from its original ideas of
			accessibility and diversity.</p>

		<p>In the early days of the internet content was largely created by individuals or specific communities, often
			centered on personal expression and authentic interactions. As Wagner explains, the internet offered a space
			where anyone could share their thoughts, hobbies, and experiences without being forced by corporate
			agendas. There was a sense of freedom online where content could be created and shared by anyone, regardless
			of
			their financial resources. This early internet was a place of creativity and exploration, characterized by
			diversity and self expression where people could create content for the sake of sharing ideas rather than
			for
			generating clicks or income.</p>


		<p>However, as the internet grew in popularity so did the rise of powerful platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and
			Instagram. These platforms developed advanced algorithms to curate and recommend content to users. Wagner
			highlights how these algorithms were designed to boost user engagement by promoting content that would
			generate the most clicks, views, and shares. Over time this shift in focus led to a more commercialized and
			profit driven internet. Content that was engaging, amazing, and designed to attract the largest possible
			audience began to dominate, pushing aside the more personal content that once thrived in the early
			internet days. As a result, the diversity of content and voices available on the internet began to shrink,
			and
			corporate interests started to define what people saw and consumed online.</p>

		<p>Wagner also critiques the way in which algorithms have shaped the content we see online. The recommendation
			systems of platforms like YouTube shows videos that's often promoting interesting or emotionally charged
			content.
			This algorithmic selection creates an environment where content is
			optimized for maximum engagement, often at the expense of originality, diversity, or personal expression. As
			Wagner points out, these systems reward content that keeps users glued to their screens, resulting in the
			dominance of viral videos, clickbait, and shallow content over more thoughtful or creative material. This
			shift
			has led to an internet that feels increasingly combined, with content designed to appeal to the lowest
			common
			denominator rather than fostering diverse, meaningful dialogue or creative expression.</p>

		<p>Another point Wagner makes is that this algorithmic prioritization of engagement has had a profound impact on
			content creators. Individuals could freely share their experiences or create content without worrying
			about how it would be received by advertisers or platforms. However, many content creators feel pressure
			to cater to the interests of advertisers or the algorithmic preferences of platforms. As Wagner notes
			creators
			are often forced to create content that will generate the most views, likes, or shares, which can result in
			a
			loss of authenticity and originality. The need to cater to commercial interests can stifle creativity,
			pushing
			creators to produce content that is more predictable, sensational, and designed to capture attention rather
			than
			content that is personal or reflective.</p>

		<p>Wagner’s essay also emphasizes the implications of this shift in the structure of the internet. As the
			internet becomes increasingly dominated by corporate interests and algorithmic content curation, the
			opportunities for individual expression, community building, and content creation have become more
			limited. The market of the internet has created a system where everything is manipulated and content
			is no longer created for the sake of sharing ideas, but for the sake of maximizing engagement and generating
			profit. The authenticity and individuality are often sacrificed in favor of content that is
			designed to be consumed by the largest possible audience.</p>

		<p>Ultimately, Wagner’s essay challenges readers to think crucially about the direction the internet is heading.
			The internet was once a place of great potential, offering the opportunity for people to connect, create,
			and
			share their ideas with the world. As the internet has become more commercialized and algorithm driven,
			the diversity of voices and content has disappeared, and the spirit of openness and free expression has also
			disappeared.
			Wagner urges us to reflect on the consequences of this transformation and to consider how we might
			restore the internet’s original ideals. How can we reclaim the internet as a space for creativity,
			individuality, and authentic connection in the face of increasing marketing? Wagner’s essay is a call to
			action for those who wish to preserve the internet’s original promise and prevent it from becoming a space
			that
			is solely shaped by profit driven motives.</p>
