    <h3>1. The Rules of Their World</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Never whistle at night. It calls them, and they do not always come in peace.</li>
      <li>Do not disturb their homes. Hollow trees, caves, and abandoned places belong to them.</li>
      <li>Always ask permission. Before entering the forest, before taking what is not yours, before speaking of them
        too loudly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Eyewitness accounts and historical records confirm that those who break these rules often face consequences:
      illness, lost time, objects moving on their own, or far worse.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Small Feet in the Dirt: Unexplained Physical Evidence</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tiny footprints appearing overnight, leading nowhere.</li>
      <li>Unusual claw-like scratches on walls and furniture.</li>
      <li>Half-eaten food left in places where no one had been.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These physical traces suggest that duendes are not mere spirits but tangible beings that interact with the
      physical world when they choose to.
    </p>

    <h3>3. The Vanishing Children Phenomenon</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A sudden change in personality — withdrawn, quiet, or oddly amused.</li>
      <li>Speaking of “little friends” that no one else can see.</li>
      <li>Waking up in strange places, unable to recall how they got there.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some cultures leave offerings to the duendes to ensure a child's safe return. Others never speak of them at all,
      hoping silence will grant protection.
