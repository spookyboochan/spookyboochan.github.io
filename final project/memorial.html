    <h2>Memorial</h2>
    <p>Throughout history, there have been those who ignored the warnings. They disturbed sacred ground,
      mocked the unseen, or entered places where no human was meant to tread. Some were found dazed,
      changed, never quite themselves again. Others simply disappeared.
      This memorial is dedicated to those who encountered duendes and were never the same. Each name,
      each story, is a reminder: respect is the only protection.</p>
