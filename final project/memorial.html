      <p class="intro">
        Not all who wander return the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are whispers of names forgotten by time — travelers, children, and skeptics who crossed into the realm of the duendes without knowing the cost. Some vanished without a trace. Others came back... altered, as if shadows clung to their memories.
      </p>
      <p>
        This memorial honors those souls. Each story etched here is a quiet echo, a caution carried on the wind. They remind us: the unseen is not the unreal, and the forest has ears.

          <li><em>Elena Márquez</em> — Last seen near the hollow cedar. Her laughter still heard on quiet nights.</li>
          <li><em>Tomás Delgado</em> — Returned from the mountains, silent and wide-eyed. Spoke only in riddles until his final day.</li>
          <li><em>The Rivera Twins</em> — Found asleep in the field with strange symbols traced in the dirt around them.</li>
          <li><em>Unnamed Shepherd</em> — Only his whistle was found, lying in a perfect circle of moss.</li>
