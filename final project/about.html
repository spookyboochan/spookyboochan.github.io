    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Duendes are small, mythical creatures found in the folklore of various cultures, particularly in Spain and
      Latin America. They are often described as mischievous beings, sometimes helping humans but other
      times causing trouble by stealing objects, making noises in the night, or leading travelers astray. Duendes
      falls into what can be called a "fictitious truth" a narrative that, while not verifiably real, holds cultural
      significance and remains compelling across generations.
