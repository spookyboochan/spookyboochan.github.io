    <h2>About</h2>

    <p class="about-intro">
      Some say duendes are just stories. Others swear they’ve seen them — just for a second — vanishing into a thicket or whispering from the walls. Wherever they come from, they have followed us for centuries.
    </p>

    <div class="about-content">
      <p>
        Duendes are small, elusive creatures deeply rooted in folklore from Spain, Latin America, and beyond. Known by many names and appearances, they’re often described as playful — sometimes helpful, but often mischievous. 
      </p>

      <p>
        They hide objects, tangle hair, mimic voices, and leave muddy footprints where none should be. Sometimes they protect. Sometimes they trick. But always, they remind us that the natural world has its own rules — and watchers.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “They dwell where logic ends — in the quiet corners where stories are born, and things go missing.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In academic terms, duendes belong to what some call a <strong>“fictitious truth.”</strong> That is, their reality cannot be proven, yet their presence is deeply felt. Passed down through generations, they are more than myth — they are cultural memory made flesh.
